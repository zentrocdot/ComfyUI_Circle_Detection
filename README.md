## Introduction

<p align="justify">Next to AI mathematical methods can be used for the detection of objects like a circle. This node is using Hough's transform for the detection of circles in an given image. The advantage of mathematical methods is that the recognised circles can be virtually predicted. I utilise this to create masks.</p>

## Usage

After installation the node can be find in the node menu

  Add Node > ðŸ§¬ Circle Detection Nodes > ðŸ”¬ Circle Detection

For showing data one can use following node

   Add Node > ðŸ§¬ Circle Detection Nodes > ðŸ—ƒ Circle Detection

## Installation

Use the ComfyUI Manager for the installation of the node.

You can also move int the directory ComfyUI/custom_nodes

<code>git clone https://github.com/zentrocdot/ComfyUI_Circle_Detection</code>

# Example

<img src="./images/ComfyUI_0001.jpeg" alt="button panel">
<p><i>Figure 1: Original image</i></p>

<img src="./images/ComfyUI_0002.jpeg" alt="button panel">
<p><i>Figure 2: Image with circles detected</i></p>

# To-Do

Troubleshooting in the node programming and sanitizing up the code.

## Remarks

The first image created is the one, where on can see, which circles are found. The seond image looks like a mask, but it is not for the moment. 
It is still an blank image, where the found circles are filled drawn. This changed in version 0.0.0.3.
