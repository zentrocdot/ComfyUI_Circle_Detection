# ComfyUI Circle Detection Node [![Copus - Post](https://img.shields.io/badge/Copus-Post-00aaee)](https://www.copus.io/work/93ba7f55a26845cd9666854a750a80f1) [![ComfyUI - Homepage](https://img.shields.io/badge/ComfyUI-Homepage-aa00ee)](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)

## Introduction

<p align="justify">Next to AI mathematical methods can be used for the detection of objects like a circle. This node is using Hough's transform for the detection of circles in an given image. The advantage of mathematical methods is that the recognised circles can be virtually predicted. I utilise this to create masks.</p>

## Usage

After installation the node can be find in the node menu

* Add Node > ðŸ§¬ Circle Detection Nodes > ðŸ”¬ Circle Detection

For showing data one can use following node

* Add Node > ðŸ§¬ Circle Detection Nodes > ðŸ—ƒ Circle Detection

<p align="justify">The first node is the node for the circle detection. The second node is for viewing data from the circle detection node.</p>

## What the Node Does

### Node Input / Output

The input of the node is an image. The output of the node is

+ image_output
+ image_mask
+ mask
+ data
+ help

The help output can be shown with an text/string ouptput node. 

### Settings

#### List of Settings

- threshold_canny_edge
- threshold_circle_center
- minR
- maxR
- dp
- minDist
- color_tuple_cicles
- color_tuple_bg
- color_tuple_fg
- thickness

### Setting exclude_circles   

<p align="justify">As I wrote earlier mathematical methods produce on each run the same results. One can take advantage of this.
After first run one can exclude circles which were detected in the first run.</p>p>

## Installation

Use the ComfyUI Manager for the installation of the node.

You can also move int the directory ComfyUI/custom_nodes

<code>git clone https://github.com/zentrocdot/ComfyUI_Circle_Detection</code>

# Example

<img src="./images/ComfyUI_0001.jpeg" alt="button panel" width="512">
<p><i>Figure 4: Original image</i></p>

<img src="./images/ComfyUI_0002.jpeg" alt="button panel" width="512">
<p><i>Figure 5: Image with circles detected</i></p>

# To-Do

Troubleshooting in the node programming and sanitizing up the code.

## Remarks

<p align="justify">The first image created is the one, where on can see, which circles are found. The seond image looks like a mask, but it is not for the moment. 
It is still an blank image, where the found circles are filled drawn. This changed in version 0.0.0.3.</p>
